To run, simply enter the following on the command line:
python run_steps.py


Here are good things to test, in order to see the full ability of the code:

When asked, input a path to each of the four pdb files. 
Since the pdb files are in the same folder, the paths are just:
./1HVR.pdb
./4MC1.pdb
./4QJ6.pdb
./4U8W.pdb

Each of the four pdb files will contain different types of molecules,
and thus allow you to extract different things.

First, when prompted, input a type (e.g. Chain).
Then, when prompted, input a specific thing, things, or all. (e.g. A) (e.g. B C F) (e.g. All)
Make sure to only input what is listed as a possibility.

Here is what can be extracted from each file:
1HVR.pdb: Chain, Ligand, Nonstandard Residue
	  [[A, B], [XK2], [CSO]]
4MC1.pdb: Chain, Solvent, Something Else
	  [[A, B], [HOH], [CL, A526, B526, BHOH, AHOH]]
4QJ6.pdb: Chain, Ligand, Solvent
	  [[A,B,C,D,E,F], [SO4], [HOH]]
4U8W.pdb: Chain, Ligand, Solvent, Something Else
	  [[A,B], [ACT], [HOH], [AG10, BG10, NA, CL, BHOH, AHOH]]

When extracting a certain type, take turns extracting:
 one thing, 
 multiple things (in any order, just separated with a space),
 All.

Pruning, the creation of the jmol script to place hydrogens, and execution (and visualization) of the script 
are all done without user input and separated by a prompt asking the user whether they want to continue or quit.
